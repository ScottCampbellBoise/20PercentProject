For the past week, in this project, i have crated a large JPanel, in which i have ustilized a swing timer and java 2d graphics, to create a basic tennis game that allows the players to move left, right, forward and backwards as well as one player being able to hit the ball. Additionally, the project had me make a human body shape as well as original graphics in the court image that gives depth and persecive. This friday specifically, i worked on debugging the numerous issues involved in the graphics manipulation. I suspect the issue lies within the fact that there are issues in the projects coding regarding how the ball reacts to the player coordinate-wise. I feel that if ia am able to fix this issue, that the rest of the project will go very smoothly, and i will be able to add different options and additional perks All in all, i think that i am well on tract for reaching my first deliverable, one i fix the issues i suspect.'
