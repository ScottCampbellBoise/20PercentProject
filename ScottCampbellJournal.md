For the past week, in this project, i have crated a large JPanel, in which i have ustilized a swing timer and java 2d graphics, to create a basic tennis game that allows the players to move left, right, forward and backwards as well as one player being able to hit the ball. Additionally, the project had me make a human body shape as well as original graphics in the court image that gives depth and persecive. This friday specifically, i worked on debugging the numerous issues involved in the graphics manipulation. I suspect the issue lies within the fact that there are issues in the projects coding regarding how the ball reacts to the player coordinate-wise. I feel that if ia am able to fix this issue, that the rest of the project will go very smoothly, and i will be able to add different options and additional perks All in all, i think that i am well on tract for reaching my first deliverable, one i fix the issues i suspect.'

This last week, I have been working out the bugs regarding the players and how and where the ball goes when it is hit. I have been working on an algorithm that will generate a random set of coordinates for the ball to go to, so that the players could avoid staying in the same place hitting the ball back and forth. Additionally, I have been working on the computer player’s ability to move its racket to the ball and hit it back to the user player, however, I have not been able to get the computer player to return the ball for some reason. I additionally did some research and figured out how to implement different options to be available before the game setup. I have currently been working on the one player scenario with a computer player that can be set to different difficulties, and have started planning on making different game sets where there could be a two player option and possibly a doubles game option.'

This week, I completed the graphics in the computer versus the human player, as well as adding a new function that allows the computer to switch the image of the player based upon the position of the player in relation to the position of the tennis Ball. If the ball is to the left, the players racket would move to the left. Right now I am working on fixing a way to modify the computer’s ability to return the ball based on the difficulty level selected, however, I have not finished that. Lastly this week I have been working on implementing text fields to allow the player to input image pathways to personalize the tennis games with faces and or court backgrounds. I also have been trying and researching how to put images inside shapes so that the image is appropriate size and shape. I feel like this week was more focused on research and ideas on how to implement different functions of the game.'

This Week, I worked on my Graphics User Interface, which allows the user, when presented with the introduction screen, different game play options, such as player difficulty, game backgrounds: using a JTextField to let the user input a string of a color, image pathway, or color concentrations with red, green and blue. Additionally, I improved my Tennis Main class that creates a new JFrame when the actual game is going to be played.  Lastly, I created the computer player with a basic algorithm that moves his relative to the ball position as well as the improved portion that prevents him from teleporting to the balls position every time, and now rather, he moves at a designated speed that is determined by the users choice of player difficulty. I have had issues with drawing the proper buffered image to create the inputted file pathway, and mainly have had issues with drawing it on the game background. However, I feel I am well on my way to my second deliverable. As of now, the last thing I need to do is to allow the Game to stop and wait for one of the players to serve.
