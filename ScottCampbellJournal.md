For the past week, in this project, i have crated a large JPanel, in which i have ustilized a swing timer and java 2d graphics, to create a basic tennis game that allows the players to move left, right, forward and backwards as well as one player being able to hit the ball. Additionally, the project had me make a human body shape as well as original graphics in the court image that gives depth and persecive. This friday specifically, i worked on debugging the numerous issues involved in the graphics manipulation. I suspect the issue lies within the fact that there are issues in the projects coding regarding how the ball reacts to the player coordinate-wise. I feel that if ia am able to fix this issue, that the rest of the project will go very smoothly, and i will be able to add different options and additional perks All in all, i think that i am well on tract for reaching my first deliverable, one i fix the issues i suspect.'

This last week, I have been working out the bugs regarding the players and how and where the ball goes when it is hit. I have been working on an algorithm that will generate a random set of coordinates for the ball to go to, so that the players could avoid staying in the same place hitting the ball back and forth. Additionally, I have been working on the computer playerâ€™s ability to move its racket to the ball and hit it back to the user player, however, I have not been able to get the computer player to return the ball for some reason. I additionally did some research and figured out how to implement different options to be available before the game setup. I have currently been working on the one player scenario with a computer player that can be set to different difficulties, and have started planning on making different game sets where there could be a two player option and possibly a doubles game option.'
